# rock-paper-scissors
A very basic Rock Paper Scissors game made in Javascript and can be played using the Browser's console.

# Todo
- Make it so you can play it in the browser.
- Give it a decent design using CSS.
- Create a seperate file for the Javascript code.

These will be made at a later date.
